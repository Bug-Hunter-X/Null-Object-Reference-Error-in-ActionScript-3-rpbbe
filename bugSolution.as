```actionscript
//This code prevents the error by checking for null before accessing the property.
var myObject:Object = null;
if (myObject != null) {
  trace(myObject.someProperty); 
} else {
  trace("myObject is null. Cannot access property.");
}

//Alternatively, use the conditional operator
trace(myObject != null ? myObject.someProperty : "myObject is null");
```
